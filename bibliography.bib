abstract = {In the Markov decision process (MDP) formalization of reinforcement learning, a single adaptive agent interacts with an environment defined by a probabilistic transition function. In this solipsis-tic view, secondary agents can only be part of the environment and are therefore fixed in their behavior. The framework of Markov games allows us to widen this view to include multiple adaptive agents with interacting or competing goals. This paper considers a step in this direction in which exactly two agents with diametrically opposed goals share an environment. It describes a Q-learning-like algorithm for finding optimal policies and demonstrates its application to a simple two-player game in which the optimal policy is probabilistic.}

	abstract = {Quantum systems interacting with an unknown environment are notoriously difficult to model, especially in presence of non-Markovian and non-perturbative effects. Here we introduce a neural network based approach, which has the mathematical simplicity of the Gorini--Kossakowski--Sudarshan--Lindblad master equation, but is able to model non-Markovian effects in different regimes. This is achieved by using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for defining Lindblad operators that can keep track of memory effects. Building upon this framework, we also introduce a neural network architecture that is able to reproduce the entire quantum evolution, given an initial state. As an application we study how to train these models for quantum process tomography, showing that RNNs are accurate over different times and regimes.},

Understanding what makes individuals unique (their hereditary qualities, climate, and way of life) is integral to moving the focal point of health care from treating disease to conveying the best consideration for all individuals throughout their lives. This is the guarantee of customized health care. We are at a tipping point that will assist in transforming this guarantee into a reality. Advances in science, data, examinations, calculations, and computerized innovation empower us to understand the elements that influence every person's well-being with more clarity than at any previous time in history. With these data, we can further develop care at each stage, from keeping people well to detecting and preventing illness, giving the perfect drugs at the ideal time, and continuously checking the progression of disease and the results of therapy . Further developments in this direction will change results for patients and permit the frameworks for well-being to use assets more proficiently and successfully. The heterogeneous characteristics of such diseases and conditions presents incredible difficulties for custom-fit infection across the board and tending to the needs of neglected patient. Applying novel deep learning strategies to clinical investigations into such provocative illnesses shows promising outcomes and great potential for daccurate applications of medicine in clinical exploration and practice. In this chapter, we feature on the clinical use of Deep-Q learning procedures for choices for patient therapy and other suitable aspects of medicine. The experimental results indicate better performance compared with other popular methods of deep learning applied in personalized health care.},

	abstract = {In robotics, the ultimate goal of reinforcement learning is to endow robots with the ability to learn, improve, adapt and reproduce tasks with dynamically changing constraints based on exploration and autonomous learning. We give a summary of the state-of-the-art of reinforcement learning in the context of robotics, in terms of both algorithms and policy representations. Numerous challenges faced by the policy representation in robotics are identified. Three recent examples for the application of reinforcement learning to real-world robots are described: a pancake flipping task, a bipedal walking energy minimization task and an archery-based aiming task. In all examples, a state-of-the-art expectation-maximization-based reinforcement learning is used, and different policy representations are proposed and evaluated for each task. The proposed policy representations offer viable solutions to six rarely-addressed challenges in policy representations: correlations, adaptability, multi-resolution, globality, multi-dimensionality and convergence. Both the successes and the practical difficulties encountered in these examples are discussed. Based on insights from these particular cases, conclusions are drawn about the state-of-the-art and the future perspective directions for reinforcement learning in robotics.},

@article{MARTINEZDIAZ2018275,
	abstract = {Autonomous driving is expected to revolutionize road traffic attenuating current externalities, especially accidents and congestion. Carmakers, researchers and administrations have been working on autonomous driving for years and significant progress has been made. However, the doubts and challenges to overcome are still huge, as the implementation of an autonomous driving environment encompasses not only complex automotive technology, but also human behavior, ethics, traffic management strategies, policies, liability, etc. As a result, carmakers do not expect to commercially launch fully driverless vehicles in the short-term. From the technical perspective, the unequivocal detection of obstacles at high speeds and long distances is one of the greatest difficulties to face. Regarding traffic management strategies, all approaches share the vision that vehicles should behave cooperatively. General V2V cooperation and platooning are options being discussed, both with multiple variants. Various strategies, built from different standpoints, are being designed and validated using simulation. Besides, legal issues have already been arisen in the context of highly-automated driving. They range from the need for special driving licenses to much more intricate topics like liability in the event of an accident or privacy issues. All these legal and ethical concerns could hinder the spread of autonomous vehicles once technologically feasible. This paper provides an overview of the current state of the art in the key aspects of autonomous driving. Based on the information received in situ from top research centers in the field and on a literature review, authors highlight the most important advances and findings reached so far, discuss different approaches regarding autonomous traffic and propose a framework for future research.},

@article{nlp-rl,
	abstract = {In recent years some researchers have explored the use of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms as key components in the solution of various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. For instance, some of these algorithms leveraging deep neural learning have found their way into conversational systems. This paper reviews the state of the art of RL methods for their possible use for different problems of NLP, focusing primarily on conversational systems, mainly due to their growing relevance. We provide detailed descriptions of the problems as well as discussions of why RL is well-suited to solve them. Also, we analyze the advantages and limitations of these methods. Finally, we elaborate on promising research directions in NLP that might benefit from RL.},

@article{finance-rl,
	abstract = {Abstract The rapid changes in the finance industry due to the increasing amount of data have revolutionized the techniques on data processing and data analysis and brought new theoretical and computational challenges. In contrast to classical stochastic control theory and other analytical approaches for solving financial decision-making problems that heavily reply on model assumptions, new developments from reinforcement learning (RL) are able to make full use of the large amount of financial data with fewer model assumptions and to improve decisions in complex financial environments. This survey paper aims to review the recent developments and use of RL approaches in finance. We give an introduction to Markov decision processes, which is the setting for many of the commonly used RL approaches. Various algorithms are then introduced with a focus on value- and policy-based methods that do not require any model assumptions. Connections are made with neural networks to extend the framework to encompass deep RL algorithms. We then discuss in detail the application of these RL algorithms in a variety of decision-making problems in finance, including optimal execution, portfolio optimization, option pricing and hedging, market making, smart order routing, and robo-advising. Our survey concludes by pointing out a few possible future directions for research.},

abstract = {We show how a standard tool from statistics --- namely confidence bounds --- can be used to elegantly deal with situations which exhibit an exploitation-exploration trade-off. Our technique for designing and analyzing algorithms for such situations is general and can be applied when an algorithm has to make exploitation-versus-exploration decisions based on uncertain information provided by a random process. We apply our technique to two models with such an exploitation-exploration trade-off. For the adversarial bandit problem with shifting our new algorithm suffers only O((ST)1/2) regret with high probability over T trials with S shifts. Such a regret bound was previously known only in expectation. The second model we consider is associative reinforcement learning with linear value functions. For this model our technique improves the regret from O(T3/4) to O(T1/2).},
